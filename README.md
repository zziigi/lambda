# What it does
This is a repository of various Lambdas that I have written over the years. They do various tasks such as CRUD operation in Dynamo, fetch image from S3, post event to Amazon EventBridge, check EC2 tags etc. Please let me know if you have aquestion on a specific program.

# Things I learned
* AWS Lambda
* Python coding
* AWS API SDK (Boto3)
* Event driven patterns
* DynamoDB

# How to run?
* Create a Lambda function from AWS console with Python as the language
* Create appropriate IAM role
* Once Lambda is created, paste the code from the python programs into your Lambda code
* Save and run the Lambda function!
